# Simple Linear Regression Repository
This repository contains a simple linear regression analysis, a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable. The goal is to provide clear implementations, examples, and insights into the workings of simple linear regression.

## Purpose
The primary objectives of this repository are to:

### Model Implementation:
Document the implementation of simple linear regression on various datasets.

### Parameter Exploration:
Analyze the effects of different parameters on the regression model's performance.

### Visualizations:
Include visual representations of regression lines and residuals to enhance understanding of model behavior.

## Methodology
Data Preparation:
Preprocess datasets, including cleaning, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets.

### Model Training:
Implement simple linear regression using libraries such as Scikit-learn.

### Model Evaluation:
Assess model performance using metrics like R-squared, mean squared error, and residual analysis.

### Visualization:
Create plots to visualize the regression line and data points, showcasing the fit of the model.

## Technologies Used
### Python:
Primary programming language for implementing simple linear regression.

### Scikit-learn:
Library used for building and evaluating regression models.

### Pandas:
For data manipulation and preprocessing.

### Matplotlib and Seaborn:
For data visualization.

## Future Developments
As I continue to explore regression techniques, I plan to expand this repository to include multiple linear regression and explore interactions among multiple variables.
